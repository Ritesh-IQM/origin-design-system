# No Movement Indicator

## Overview
The **No Movement Indicator** is a neutral status icon used in the leaderboard to represent a state where a user’s rank has **not changed** between two comparison points.

It communicates stability without implying success or failure.

## Purpose

This icon is intentionally minimal to avoid emotional pressure in competitive or progress-based contexts.
